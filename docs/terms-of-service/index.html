            <p>Copyright Complaints: ResoNova respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do
                the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
                infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify
                ResoNova in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</p>
            <p>ResoNova will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions
                under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws

                should be sent to: <a href="mailto:info@resonova.com" target="_blank">info@resonova.com</a>.</p>
            <p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>
            <p>1. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
                copyright or other intellectual property interest.</p>

            <p>4. Your address, telephone number, and email address.</p>
            <p>5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the
                copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.</p>
            <p>6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is
                accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the
                copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.</p>
            <p><b>SECURITIES PRODUCTS</b></p>
            <p>None of the information contained in the publicly accessible portions of the ResoNova Sites constitutes
                a recommendation, solicitation or offer by ResoNova or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities,

                service. The information contained in the ResoNova Sites has been prepared without reference to any
                particular user’s investment requirements or financial situation. The information and services provided
                on the ResoNova Sites are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any
                jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or
                regulations of any governmental authority or regulatory or self-regulatory organization or clearing
                organization or where ResoNova is not authorized to provide such information or services. Some products
                and services described in the ResoNova Sites may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all
                clients.</p>
            <p><b>INDEMNITY AND RELEASE</b></p>
            <p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold ResoNova harmless from any from any and all losses, damages,
                expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury
                (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the ResoNova Sites. If you are a California
                resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend
                to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
                the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If
                you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>
            <p><b>CHOICE OF LAW</b></p>
            <p>The Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
                of Georgia, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by you
                and us, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach hereof, shall be finally
                resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial
                Arbitration Rules, or such arbitration body as required by law, rule or regulation, and judgment upon
                the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration
                will be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator in the City of Atlanta, Georgia.
                Such arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. If
                for any reason any provision of this Agreement, or a portion thereof, shall be unenforceable, that
                provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of this
                Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement
                constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to this site and it supersedes all
                prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements and understandings between ResoNova and you with
                respect to the subject matter hereof. A printed version of this Agreement shall be admissible in
                judicial or administrative proceedings.</p>
